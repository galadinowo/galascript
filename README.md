# Galascript

Galascript is a [Underscript](https://feildmaster.github.io/UnderScript/) plugin for the web browser game [Undercards](https://undercards.net). It adds miscellaneous features to the game, ranging from useful to intentionally counterproductive.

## Features

You know, I could write everything about it right here. Every little knob and lever, laid out for your viewing pleasure.

I just think jumping in blind is a fun idea. That's all :3

## Bugs! Ow ouchie

There's always bound to be some bugs, I'm not perfect! The best way to tell me about them is on Discord, through [my UCR channel](https://discord.com/channels/710243487303335976/1108713785046335518), [my UCO thread](https://discord.com/channels/330092826513899530/1335757313167851583), or simply through my DMs directly (user: galadino).

Have fun!
