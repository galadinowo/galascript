# Galascript

Galascript is a [Underscript](https://feildmaster.github.io/UnderScript/) plugin for the web browser game [Undercards](https://undercards.net). It adds miscellaneous features to the game, ranging from useful to intentionally counterproductive.

## Installation

Both Underscript and Galascript are [tampermonkey](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey) userscripts. Their download links expect that you have the tampermonkey extension to properly work!

If not already, make sure you have Underscript installed. The latest download link can be found [here](https://feildmaster.github.io/UnderScript/).

## Features

You know, I could write everything about it right here. Every little knob and lever, laid out for your viewing pleasure.

I just think jumping in blind is a fun idea. That's all :3

## Bugs! Ow ouchie

There's always bound to be some bugs, I'm not perfect! The best way to tell me about them is on Discord, through [the Galascript channel in UCO](https://discord.com/channels/330092826513899530/1396215791946301542) or my DMs directly (user: galadino).

Have fun!
